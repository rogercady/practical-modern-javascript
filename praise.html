  <p>JavaScript is a tough language to master, and the 2015 edition adds a lot of new features. <em>Practical Modern JavaScript</em> helps break them down and explains use cases, conceptual models, and best practices, with simple examples—making these new patterns much easier to grasp.</p>

  <p>ES6 brought significant changes to the language—changes that take time to grasp even for advanced JavaScript developers. You'll need a guide on this journey, and Nicolás' book is one of the best you can get.</p>

  <p>When I created JavaScript in 1995, I had no definite idea that it would become the most widely used programming language on the Internet. This Modular JavaScript book series fulfills my hope for an incremental and straightforward pedagogy about JavaScript. I encourage you to dive in, to discover and embrace JavaScript, and to contribute to developing a better web for everyone.</p>
